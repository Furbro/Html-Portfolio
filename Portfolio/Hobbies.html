		<h2>Reading</h2>
		<p>
			I love to read something that just pulls me in. Like "the wandering inn",
			a book about viking gods, or a book about a ninja.
		</p>
		<h2>Fishing</h2>
		<p>
			It seems that something primal in me awakens when I'm fishing. How can I
			not do this more often?
		</p>
		<h2>Golfing</h2>
		<p>
			I really like when I relax and play golf on a nice day with my father or
			maybe a friend.
		</p>
		<h2>Plants</h2>
		<p>
			In recent years I started enjoying growing plants. I started to find out
			how to get the plants to grow strong, but the more time I spend on it, the
			more I enjoy it.
