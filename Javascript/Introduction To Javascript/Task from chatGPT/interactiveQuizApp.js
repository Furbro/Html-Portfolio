Task: Interactive Quiz App
Create a simple Interactive Quiz App that allows users to answer questions and receive immediate feedback on their answers. This project will help you practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on how to use parameters and arguments in functions.

JavaScript Logic:

Create an array of question objects, each containing:
The question text.
An array of possible answers.
The correct answer.
Write a function to display each question and possible answers dynamically.
Use event listeners on buttons to handle user input (when they select an answer).
A function that checks if the selected answer is correct and provides feedback.
A score counter that keeps track of the user's correct answers.
At the end of the quiz, display the user's score and a message based on their performance.
Parameters and Arguments:

Use parameters in your functions to pass data, such as the current question index or user-selected answer.
Use arguments when calling those functions to pass specific values.
Bonus Features:
Add a Timer: Give the user a limited amount of time to answer each question.
Shuffle Questions: Randomize the order of questions each time the quiz starts.
Track High Scores: Store the highest score in the browser's localStorage and display it at the end.
Provide Hints: Add a hint button that shows additional information about the question but deducts points if used.
